# :gear: REST and SOAP API testing via Postman

1) I tested all methods that are provided for https://petstore.swagger.io/ in Postman and created the corresponding collections:
<li> <a href="https://www.postman.com/supply-pilot-49264861/explore/collection/55oyb99/petstore-swagger-io?action=share&creator=36752958"> Postamn collection for the petstore: REST</a>  
<li> <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18ALN6iyU8tHKQ1kN3e7vJNNBLiG1awS0s5ld4n-Hsag/edit?usp=sharing"> Test cases for "store" block </a>

2) Using the following [WSDL](http://webservices.oorsprong.org/websamples.countryinfo/CountryInfoService.wso?WSDL), I created a working collection in Postman that can be used to determine: a country's currency, full country information, and list of continents by name:
<li> <a href="https://www.postman.com/supply-pilot-49264861/workspace/explore/collection/36752958-0bd2ddd3-db30-4351-8f2a-7b0d04ae5611?action=share&creator=36752958"> Postman collection:  SOAP </a>
